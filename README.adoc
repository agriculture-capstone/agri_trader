This project is a mobile application to be used by traders that interact with farmers to collect agricultural goods.

== Development

=== Setting up a Development Environment via Docker

A Docker development environment has been made available, to use it follow the steps below.

IMPORTANT: This does not work on native docker for Windows and OS X.
This works natively on Linux and it can work on Docker Toolbox by link:https://gist.github.com/stonehippo/e33750f185806924f1254349ea1a4e68[passing the USB device through to VirtualBox] first.

. Install Docker using the instructions on the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[official website].
Do not use a package manager as you will get an outdated version of Docker.

. Give executable permissions to the utility script using `chmod +x dockerize.sh`.

. Build the image using `./dockerize.sh init`.
This may take a while.

. Install the node modules using `./dockerize.sh install`.

. Plug in your phone to your computer and allow access to your phone.
Allowing access to your phone varies per phone, but is common for a pop-up to show on a device shortly after plugging it in to a computer.
Ensure the cable connecting the phone and computer is capable of data transfer and not just power.

. Identify the path to your phone.
This can be done using `lsusb`.
For example the output could be:
+
[source,bash]
----
user@user-pc ~/boresha/agritrader $ lsusb
Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 093a:2521 Pixart Imaging, Inc. Optical Mouse
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0534:0002 Motorola, Inc.
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 055: ID 04e8:6860 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd Galaxy (MTP)
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:0a03 Logitech, Inc. Logitech USB Microphone
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
----
+
The path would then be `/dev/bus/usb/001/055` for the Samsung device (phone).

. Check that the Docker image can find your phone using `./dockerize.sh adb-devices /path/to/device/`.
The output should include a device.
+
[source,bash]
----
user@user-pc ~/boresha/agritrader $ ./dockerize.sh adb /dev/bus/usb/001/055
List of devices attached
* daemon not running. starting it now at tcp:5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
ce12160cdb9b2f1905	device
----

. Build the package and deploy it to your phone using `./dockerize.sh android /path/to/device`.
This should take a few minutes before anything shows up on your phone.

. Once the app is running on your phone, enable hot reloading by shaking your phone and selecting _Enable Hot Reloading_.

NOTE: The phone will need to be disconnected and reconnected for every build (`./dockerize.sh android /path/to/device`).

Any other actions can be done with the `run` action.
`./dockerize.sh run` and `npm run` are equivalent except that the former runs the environment in docker.

=== Setting up a Development Environment Locally

Follow steps found in the `Building Projects with Native Code` tab in the link:https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html[React Native documentation for Getting Started] for installing dependencies and setting up the mobile development environment, such as the Android SDK and build tools.

==== Setting up a Device

To try running the code on a device, follow the steps found in the link:https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html[React Native documentation for Running your app on a Device].

==== Common Issues

* Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` environment variables are set.

* Make sure the `adb` command is available from the terminal.
The sdk platform tools directory may have to be added to the `PATH` environment variables.
The platform tools directory can be found in `D:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools`.

* When trying to run the application on a device, make sure a phone is connected.
Use `adb devices` to check for a connected device.


==== Running the Application

Once a development environment has been setup, the application can be run with the following steps.

. Clone the repository.
. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
. Ensure a device is connected to the computer or an emulator is set up.
. Run `npm run start:android` or `npm run start:ios` to run the application.

==== Running Tests

. Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests and check code coverage thresholds.
. View code coverage in the local `coverage/` directory.
