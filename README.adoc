== Development

=== Setting up a Development Environment

Follow steps found in the `Building Projects with Native Code` tab in the link:https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html[React Native documentation for Getting Started] for installing dependencies and setting up the mobile development environment, such as the Android SDK and build tools.

=== Setting up a Device

To try running the code on a device, follow the steps found in the link:https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html[React Native documentation for Running your app on a Device].

==== Common Issues

* Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` environment variables are set.

* Make sure the `adb` command is available from the terminal.
The sdk platform tools directory may have to be added to the `PATH` environment variables.
The platform tools directory can be found in `D:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools`.

* When trying to run the application on a device, make sure a phone is connected.
Use `adb devices` to check for a connected device.


=== Running the Application

Once a development environment has been setup, the application can be run with the following steps.

. Clone the repository.
. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
. Ensure a device is connected to the computer or an emulator is set up.
. Run `npm run start:android` or `npm run start:ios` to run the application.

=== Running Tests

. Run `npm test` to execute all unit tests and check code coverage thresholds.
. View code coverage in the local `coverage/` directory.
